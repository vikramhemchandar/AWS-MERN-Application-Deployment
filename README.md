## MERN deployment on AWS Cloud

## Project Description
The project is to deploy a Travel Memory application using the MERN stack (MongoDB,  Express.js, React and Node.js)  on AWS EC2 instances using different Application Load Balancers for frontend and backend services, and storing the data in the Mongo Database ensuring scalable architecture.

## Requirements
1.	Mongo DB Connection String
2.	VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets 
3.	AMI instance with prerequisites applications installed
4.	Two EC2 instances for backend and two EC2 instances for frontend
5.	Target Group and Application Load Balancer for Backend and Frontend
6.	A domain name to host the website on internet

## Steps
1.	Backend configuration <br>
•	Configure backend with two EC2 instances <br>
•	Create a .env file to incorporate database connection details and port information <br>
•	Deploy the backend service and test with individual EC2 instances <br>
•	Create a certificate for backend using AWS Certificate Manager  <br>
•	Create an Application Load balancer with backend EC2 instances <br>
•	Configure the CNAME record to link backend load balancer endpoint [DNS] <br>
2.	Configure frontend with two EC2 instances <br>
•	Update url.js to ensure the front end communicates effectively with the backend <br>
•	Deploy the frontend and test with individual EC2 instances <br>

**Flow of the application**
 - End user opens the browser and hits https://www.vikramhemchandar.live
 - The hit goes to DNS (application load balancer end point) managed by web hosting provier (here namecheap.com)
 - The hit is routed to DNS (which is frontend ALB)
 - Frontend ALB listens on https (port 443)
 - ALB does health checks of the frontend EC2 instances
 - ALB distributes the traffic using round-robin / lead outstanding requests
 - Frontend is communicated with backend by backend DNS (in url.js)
 - The request is route to backend ALB
 - Backend ALB listens on HTTPS (port 443)
 - Backend ALB does health check on the backend EC2 instances
 - Backend ALB is communicated to EC2 instances and communicates to database which connect via connection string (in .env)
 - Response flow (reverse path): 
   - MongoDB returns data -> Backend Node.js
   - Backend Node.js returns API response -> Backend ALB
   - Backend ALB -> Frontend browser (via React)
   - React updates UI page is loaded

### 3.	Installing applications / packages and setting up reverse proxy using nginx EC2 instance <br>
Run the below unix commands: <br>

Update and upgrade the OS packages
```
> sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
Install and start NGINX
```
> sudo apt install nginx -y
> sudo systemctl start nginx
> sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
Set reverse proxy for individual instance and update the script for filename – default and path - /etc/nginx/sites-available
```
> cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
> sudo nano default
> cat default
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name vikramhemchandar.live www.vikramhemchandar.live;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Preserve client + original host info
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Good defaults
        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;
        proxy_send_timeout    60s;
        proxy_read_timeout    60s;
    }
}
```
Install NodeJS
```
> curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
> sudo apt install -y nodejs
```
**Note:** npm should be installed in the specific path for backend and frontend, hence, we will install for every EC2 instance respectively
Clone the code from GitHub Repository
```
> git clone https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/TravelMemory
```
Create a .env file to incorporate database connection details and port information
```
> sudo nano .env
> sudo nginx -t
> sudo systemctl reload nginx
> cat .env
MONGO_URI='mongodb+srv://vikram_DB:xxxxxxxx@vikramhemchandar.rtgw4pn.mongodb.net/travelmemory'
PORT=3001
```
### 4. Create an AMI Image
Create an AMI image by navigating on EC2 Instance -> Actions -> Image and templates -> Create image
<img width="468" height="326" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2004e49-3fdc-46f7-b19a-6e7ef829a050" />

### 5.	Create 3 EC2 instances from the AMI image (in total 4 – 2 for BE and 2 for FE) 
NOTE: For now, create only EC2 instance for another backend server, so, total 2 EC2 instances
<img width="468" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62cf28d6-c512-4ae2-8378-ae92f02e4445" />

### 6. Install NPM for 2 backend instances and start the backend server
Run the below commands on terminal
```
> cd TravelMemory/backend
> sudo npm install
```
Verify NodeJS and npm versions
```
> node -v
> npm -v
```
Start the backend server
```
> pwd
/home/ubuntu/TravelMemory/backend
> node index.js
http://locahost:3001
```

### 7. Verify backend server

To verify the back server, copy the public IP of two instances and paste it in any browser. And note, port number is not required  as we have configured reverse proxy<br>
Example: http://18.60.97.157/ and you should see below message – <br>
<img width="193" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a13c2605-793a-45e3-9a78-47eb385c81fa" /><br>
When you suffix /hello to the above IP address, you should see Hello World <br>
<img width="195" height="59" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4e2848c-20e3-4f20-99e0-7e36a3f0bd46" /><br>

### 8.	Create a certificate on ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) with your domain name
**Note** – there should a domain registered in any web hosting provider

On AWS, search ACM -> go to certificate manager -> Request and follow the below steps<br>
<img width="468" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5686c4b-4763-4809-89c1-1bbe8c3d1108" /><br>
